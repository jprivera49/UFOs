# UFOs

## Summary
Ufologists have provided data from UFO sightings in different cities.  This data includes information about the shape of the sighting, the duration, and other information.  Using, Javascript, HTML, and CSS, a website was created to provide this data to other ufologists who are interested in knowing about UFO activities.  They can search through the data using filters.  These filters include:
    1. Date of activity
    2. City where activity was viewed
    3. State where activity was viewed
    4. Country where activity was viewed
    5. Shape of the activity
    
In the future, a change to be add to the website, is including picture links for the various UFO activities seen (if pictures were taken).  This would assist in creating credibility for the data given.  Another change I would do is scrape news articles and add them to the website if they discuss UFO sightings in any way.  This would help in keeping people informed.
